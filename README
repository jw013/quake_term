quake_term.sh
=============

:Version: 0.5

``quake_term.sh`` is a small flexible utility that adds Quake-like
hotkey-triggered drop-down functionality to just about any X11 terminal
emulator in most window managers/desktop environments. 

The advantage of ``quake_term.sh`` over other similar scripts lies
mainly in its flexibility and few dependencies.  The script itself is
written in portable POSIX shell (sh), and it should work with most
terminal emulators and EMWH-compliant X11 window managers.  With the one
exception of wmctrl, all of its dependencies are normally included with
any standard \*nix X11 setup.

The idea behind ``quake_term.sh`` is simple: it identifies the
drop-down-enabled terminal by setting its ``WM_CLASS`` attribute
to a fairly unique string that no other application is likely to use.
Every time it is called, it uses xprop to determine whether the
currently focused window matches the unique WM_CLASS identifier string
and minimizes/restores your drop-down terminal as appropriate.

Usage
=====

Dependencies
------------

* ``wmctrl`` `<http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/>`_
* ``xprop`` (should be included in any standard X11 installation)
* ``grep``

Setup
-----

For the most basic use case, all that is needed is to simply use your
window manager/desktop environment settings to map a keyboard shortcut
(e.g. ``Alt-```) to run ``quake_term.sh`` without arguments.
``quake_term.sh`` will automatically start the terminal if it is not
already running, and toggle between minimizing/focus the window
otherwise.  The default terminal emulator is current xterm (technically,
``lxterm``, a locale-sensitive wrapper).

Openbox example configuration
-----------------------------
This configuration works with roxterm and urxvt, but probably will work
with your favorite terminal emulator.

Adding the keybind
Open your /home/username/.config/openbox/rc.xml
    <!-- Open the terminal when you press ``Alt-``` -->
    <keybind key="A-0x31">
      <action name="Execute">
        <execute>/home/username/bin/quake_term.sh</execute>
      </action>
    </keybind>

Windows without borders and in the top (Quake alike)
Jump to <applications> group and add this lines
    <application name="roxterm">
      <decor>no</decor>
      <position force="yes">
        <x>center</x>
        <y>0</y>
      </position>
      <desktop>all</desktop>
      <layer>above</layer>
      <skip_pager>yes</skip_pager>
      <skip_taskbar>yes</skip_taskbar>
      <maximized>Horizontal</maximized>
    </application>


Using a different terminal emulator
-----------------------------------

If a command called ``quake_term_term`` exists in your ``$PATH``,
``quake_term.sh`` will invoke that instead of the default terminal
emulator.  The ``quake_term_term`` if it exists must take a single
argument consisting of the window class (``WM_CLASS``) string described
above.

Tested setups
-------------

**Terminals**

* ``rxvt-unicode``
* ``xterm`` (and variants)
  
**Window Managers**

* ``openbox`` 
  
If you've tried this with other terminals and window managers, please
feel free to add them here.

Limitations
===========

Currently, due to the way it is designed, quake_term.sh only supports 
one drop-down-enabled terminal at a time - it is not possible to have 
multiple drop-down-terminals running simultaneously.  If this bothers 
you, see the "Contact" section for bug reports / patch submissions / 
feature requests.

Some limited testing seems to indicate that ``wmctrl`` does not correctly hide
or minimize windows in the ``metacity`` window manager.

Changelog
=========

*   parameterized the terminal emulator command so ``quake_term.sh`` can
    be used with other emulators without editing the script itself
