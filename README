``quake_term.sh`` is a small flexible utility that adds Quake-like 
drop-down functionality to just about any X11 terminal emulator in most 
window managers/desktop environments. 

The advantage of ``quake_term.sh`` over other similar scripts lies
mainly in its flexibility and few dependencies.  The script itself is
written in the fairly portable POSIX shell (sh) and should work with
most terminal emulators EMWH-compliant X11 window manager.  With the one
exception of wmctrl, all of its dependencies are normally already
installed with any standard \*nix X11 setup.  Finally, quake_term.sh is
entirely self-contained -- everything is done in one shell script, and
no external temporary files are needed.

The idea behind ``quake_term.sh`` is simple: it identifies the
drop-down-enabled terminal by setting its ``WM_CLASS`` attribute
to a fairly unique string that no other application is likely to use.
Every time it is called, it uses xprop to determine whether the
currently focused window matches the unique WM_CLASS identifier string
and minimizes/restores your drop-down terminal as appropriate.

Usage
=====

Dependencies
------------

* ``wmctrl`` `<http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/>`_
* ``xprop`` (should be included in any standard X11 installation)
* ``grep``

Setup
-----

For the most basic use case, all that is needed is to simply use your 
window manager/desktop environment settings to map a keyboard shortcut 
(e.g. ``Alt-```) to run quake_term.sh.  quake_term.sh will automatically 
start the terminal if it is not already running, and toggle between 
minimizing/focus the window otherwise.

Using a different terminal emulator
-----------------------------------

As long as your terminal emulator has a command-line option to set its
WM_CLASS attribute, it can be used with quake_term.  Simply change the
command line that runs the default terminal (currently ``lxterm``) to
run your terminal emulator with the appropriate switches instead.

Tested setups
-------------

**Terminals**

* ``rxvt-unicode``
* ``xterm``
  
**Window Managers**

* ``openbox`` 
  
If you've tried this with other terminals and window managers, please
feel free to add them here.

Limitations
===========

Currently, due to the way it is designed, quake_term.sh only supports 
one drop-down-enabled terminal at a time - it is not possible to have 
multiple drop-down-terminals running simultaneously.  If this bothers 
you, see the "Contact" section for bug reports / patch submissions / 
feature requests.

Choosing which terminal emulator to use is currently done by editing 
quake_term.sh itself, which is not very multi-user friendly or 
particularly convenient.  In a future release, the terminal emulator 
command will be specified as arguments instead of being hard-coded.
